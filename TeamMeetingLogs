Monday October 28: No Decisions made, no alternative actions discussed, follow-up actions implemented.

Monday November 04:
- Team memebers discussed future roles they will take on for the next week of the project and are now on the project board.
- Decisions were made about how the team will use the project board to show status of project. This included a seperate section on the project board called over arching tasks that will be used to keep memebers organized. Tasks will be taken out of over arching tasks and moved to the project board where the subtasks are displayed.
- There are no pending tasks that need to be complete before another section of the project is able to be compledted.
- Jacob mentioned a possible issue with docker that the team will need to fix in the coming week. This doesnt pose a major issue to the overall project.
