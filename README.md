# Bounty-Board-Project

Bounty board is an app where users can post any task from homework help to yard work. 
Users who want to post bounties can put a price on anything they want done. 
They can choose from pricing by a set price. 
Users that want to complete bounties can upload a resume and sort through bounties by categories and price.
